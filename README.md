# R_statistics_exercises

Repository for the exercises of the Advanced statistics for physics analysis course. Part of the Physics of data master degree at UniPd.
The exercises are solved using the R language. :computer:

Below you can find all the exercises carried out during the course. They are all coded in a R-kernel Jupyter Notebook except for the ladt one which is developed with R-studio.

* Exercises R Laboratory 01 :

First exercises in R to become familiar with the syntax and to start writing some basic instructions. In particular, the last one consists of a brief analysis of Covid-19 Vaccine data.

* Exercises R Laboratory 02:

Review of basic probability concepts,

Probability distributions in R
* Exercises R Laboratory 03:

Random numbers generation,

Markov’s inequality,

Chebyshev’s inequality,

The Six Boxes Toy Model: inference and simulation.
* Exercises R Laboratory 04:

Community Mobility Open Data (analysis of Covid-19 data sets), 

Random number generation using the middle square algorithm,

Bayesian Inference.

* Exercises R Laboratory 05:

Bayesian inference for a Poisson process,
